Document your process and connections for scalability. Use Figma to set up design files. For the UI kit, consider Figma Variables or Tokens Studio. Decide how you'll connect with developers, either through Figma API or Tokens Studio. I prefer Tokens Studio linked to a code repository like GitHub or GitLab. This setup allows me to easily update changes. Alternatively, you can export design tokens to Figma Variables for all the design system consumers. This approach allows you to restrict any edits. ### More articles Maintaining a design system in Figma Maintaining a design system in Figma requires a structured approach to ensure consistency and efficiency.
