You can choose which libraries are available in the Assets panel. To open the Assets panel: Select the Assets tab in the left sidebar, or use the shortcut: Mac: ⌥ Option 2 Windows: Alt 2 • Select a library with the component you'd like to use • Find the component you want to use • Click and drag the component onto the canvas to create an instance of that component. Tip: You can customize the appearance of the Assets tab to match your preferences. Click to switch between a grid or list view, and show or hide sub-folders.

Duplicate using the keyboard shortcut: Mac: ⌘ Command D Windows: Ctrl D ### Drag to copy You can also drag to copy a component within the same file: • Hold down ⌥ Option for Mac or Alt for Windows and drag to create an instance. • Release the click before you release the modifier key. Otherwise, Figma will move the original component instead of duplicate it. ### Copy and paste You can copy and paste any component within the same file to create an instance.

Otherwise, Figma will move the original component instead of duplicate it. ### Copy and paste You can copy and paste any component within the same file to create an instance.
