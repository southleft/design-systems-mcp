Here's how I choose the best approach. Assess development time, performance impact, and visual consistency. Weigh tradeoffs. The goal? Optimal user experience, always. Choose the best approach: ‚û°Ô∏è Hybrid approach Mix your UI elements with platform specific components. For example, you might adopt a native iOS calendar on iOS app, but keep the rest of the custom components. This way, our app feels native yet distinctly ours. ‚û°Ô∏è Platform-First design In this case we would use only platform specific UI elements. An iOS app would follow Apple's design principles for a native experience. An Android app would use Material Design for user familiarity. üö® Structure libraries Regardless of your choice, keep platform-specific elements out of your custom library. If using Figma Variables or Tokens Studio, create extra design tokens and a separate library for platform-specific styles and components. Each approach has its advantages, and the best choice will depend on your product goals. Good luck üôå Read more: What are the best practices for implementing platform-specific design guidelines?
