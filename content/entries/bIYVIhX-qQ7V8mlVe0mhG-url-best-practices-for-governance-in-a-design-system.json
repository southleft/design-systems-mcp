Romina Kavcic Define Roles: Clearly state who owns, decides, and contributes. This helps everyone understand their role. Set a Contribution Process: Let’s create easy workflows for proposing changes. Tools like GitHub or Figma can help. Also, setting clear criteria for new additions will keep things organized. Use Version Control: Implementing semantic versioning is a great idea. Keeping a changelog and having a plan to phase out old components will help keep our system up-to-date. Meetings + updatesRegular meetings with design, engineering, and product teams will help us review changes. Collaborative decision-making for the win! Also, don't forget to have monthly/quarterly meetings, where you share the progress with the whole org. Document Standards: Providing clear guidelines on usage and accessibility is essential. Let’s set coding and design standards and outline our quality assurance processes for everyone. Encourage Feedback: There is no stupid questions. 🙃 Creating open channels for input and issues is vital. Let’s offer sessions for questions and work on building a supportive community. Measure Impact: Tracking how components are used and gathering feedback will help us improve. Using this data will guide us in making better choices. Your \"north star\": Anticipating future governance needs is wise. What are your plans for scaling? Trainings: Onboarding new members is crucial. Create helpful resources and guidance to set them up for success. Align with Goals: Have your company objectives in mind.
