It helps designers and developers grasp the purpose, structure, and application of each pattern. This makes learning easier and encourages more people to adopt them. How to Organize Pattern Documentation: Purpose: Explain why the pattern exists and how to use it. Anatomy: Describe the different parts of the pattern. Behavior and Interaction: Share how the pattern works and how users should interact with it.
