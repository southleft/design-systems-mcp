Romina Kavcic Here are the steps to create a personal access token on GitHub Log in to GitHub: Open your web browser and go to GitHub [vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.esm.html]. Log in to your GitHub account. Navigate to Settings: In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings. Access Developer Settings: In the left sidebar, click Developer settings. Personal Access Tokens: In the left sidebar, click Personal access tokens. Click Tokens (classic) or Fine-Grained (currently in beta) Generate New Token: Click the Generate new token button. Configure Token: Give your token a descriptive name (where are you going to use it?) Expiration: Set an expiration date for your token. It's recommended to set an expiration date to limit the token's lifespan. Scopes: Select the scopes or permissions you'd like to grant this token. For example, if you need to access repositories, select the `repo` scope. Choose public or private. Then choose the repository. Generate Token: After configuring the token, click the Generate token button at the bottom of the page. You will get something like: `4699w08et90edsfkjfskdgasf44aasf` Copy Token: Copy the token now. You won't be able to see it again. Store it securely. ### Example Usage To integrate GitHub with Tokens Studio, you need to add a personal access token (PAT) to authenticate and access your GitHub repositories. This allows you to sync design tokens between Tokens Studio and your GitHub repository.
