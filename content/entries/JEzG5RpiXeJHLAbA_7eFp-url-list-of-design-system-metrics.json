Return on Investment (ROI): Assesses the financial return relative to the cost of implementing the design system. Adoption Rate: Indicates the percentage of products or teams utilizing the design system, reflecting its integration within the organization. Component Usage Across Products: Analyzes how design system components are reused across various products, highlighting the system's efficiency and consistency. Design to Development Time (Handoff): Measures the efficiency of the transition from design to development, tracking the speed and smoothness of the handoff process.
