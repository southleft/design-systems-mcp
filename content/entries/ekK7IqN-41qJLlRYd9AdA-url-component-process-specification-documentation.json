Detailed specifications on the component and how to build it. ## Why do we do it? So that Developers know precisely how to build the component and all the states required for it. It also helps us best understand how to make this component in Figma. ## How do we do it? Depending on if you’re creating a new component vs. updating an existing one, there are two methods for your spec doc. Create a new spec doc if your component update differs substantially from the original. ### Updating existing Updating existing components can be much simpler to document. Just include a before and after, highlight the changes and give the updated values. ### New components For new components, use a complete spec doc outlining all of the specifications from the ground up. Take each variation in the following list and run the Eightshapes Specs plugin in Figma [https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1205622541257680763/EightShapes-Specs#:~:text=Automate%20production%20of%20page%20and,work%2C%20and%20critiquing%20with%20teammates.] to break down your designs into full specs. You’ll want to review the results to make sure they line up. You can do all of this manually, but a plugin will save you a lot of time — and this one is great.
