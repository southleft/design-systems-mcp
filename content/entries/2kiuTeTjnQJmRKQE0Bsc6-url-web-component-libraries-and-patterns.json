  "content": "The Complete Web Components Resource Guide - The Design System Guide Close # The Complete Web Components Resource Guide Romina Kavcic ### Official Documentation and Specifications Web Components consist of four main technologies, though HTML Imports have been deprecated and replaced by ES Modules. Custom Elements API forms the foundation, enabling developers to define new HTML tags with custom behavior. The official specification lives in the WHATWG HTML Standard rather than standalone W3C documents, reflecting its integration into core web standards. Shadow DOM API enables style and markup encapsulation, preventing CSS conflicts and providing true component isolation. Recent additions like Declarative Shadow DOM standardized in 2023-2024 allow server-side rendering of shadow roots without JavaScript. HTML Templates provide a standardized way to declare reusable markup patterns using `<template>` and `<slot>` elements. Unlike other specifications, templates have been universally supported since early implementations. HTML Imports were deprecated in Chrome 73 (March 2019) and completely removed by 2020. ES Modules now serve as the standard replacement for component loading and dependency management. All modern browsers now fully support Web Components. Chrome led implementation since version 54, Firefox achieved full support by version 63, and Edge gained complete compatibility with its Chromium transition in January 2020. Safari supports Custom Elements and Shadow DOM but has no plans to implement Customized Built-in Elements. #### Resources MDN Web Components Documentation [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components] Using Custom Elements - MDN [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements] W3C Custom Elements Specification [https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/] Declarative Shadow DOM - Web.dev [https://web.dev/articles/declarative-shadow-dom] Custom Elements v1 - Web.dev [https://web.dev/articles/custom-elements-v1] Shadow DOM Security - Imperva [https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/shadow-dom/] Web Components - Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components] ## Learning Resources #### Beginner-Friendly Foundations MDN Web Components Documentation serves as the definitive starting point, offering comprehensive tutorials with practical examples and working implementations.
