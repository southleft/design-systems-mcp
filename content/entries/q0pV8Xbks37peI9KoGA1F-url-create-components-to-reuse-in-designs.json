Users on a Starter team can't publish Components to a Library. Users with can edit access to a file can create and edit components. Users with can view access to a file can use components from a library [https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025508373], if they have access to it. You can create a component out of any collection of objects or layers. Components can be as simple as shapes, buttons or fields, or more complex design like cards and menus. Tip! As you create components and build out your design system, you'll find the need for components that are similar to each other, with only slight differences. Variants allow you to group and organize similar components into a single container. This simplifies your component library and makes it easier for everyone to find what they need. Learn how to create and use variants → [https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594] ## Create a component You can create a single component out of selection of layers. Or, create individual components in bulk from a selection of objects. ### Create a single component There are a few ways to create a component. First, you'll need to select the layers you'd like to include in the component. • Select the layers you’d like to be included in the component. You then have a few different methods for create a component: Click the next to the selection's name in the properties panel > Create component. • Right-click on your selection and choose Create component. Use the keyboard shortcuts: Mac: ⌥ Option - ⌘ Command - K Windows: Ctrl + Alt + K • Figma will nest the layers within a special component frame. Identify components in the Layers panel using the purple icon. • In the right sidebar, click Component configuration next to the component name to add a Description and Documentation link for collaborators. Collaborators and developers can view descriptions and documentation in various places [https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/7938814091287-Add-descriptions-to-styles-components-and-variables#view-descriptions]. Tip! Figma will create a custom button if you add a link from any of the following domains: • Github • Notion • Storybook • Zeroheight • Confluence • Dropbox Paper ### Create components in bulk By default, the Create component action will create a single component from your selection. You can also create components in bulk. This allows you to select multiple groups or frames and create components out of them. Create multiple components from: • Objects and layers in frames • Objects and layers in groups • Single layers, like a path or vector network • Layers in a boolean operation Note: If you select more than one layer that isn't on one of the above configurations, Figma will create a component for each individual layer. • Select the layers you want to create components from, • Click next to the selection's name in the properties panel. • Select Create Multiple components from the options. • Figma will create a component for each frame, group, boolean operation, or path. Tip! You can hand off components for development without reorganizing your file. Create a section for your component [https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/9771500257687]. Then, mark the section as Ready for dev → [https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/9771500257687#h_01HHN2CDAMSCQ3XVSEA2JYSEQJ] ## Delete a component You can delete a component at any time. Deleting a main component does not remove instances of that component from your files. • Select the component you want to delete. • Press delete. ## Restore a component If you have an existing instance of a deleted component, you can use that instance to restore the component. Learn more about instances → [https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039150173-Create-and-insert-component-instances] There are a few ways to restore a component from an instance: ### From the right sidebar • Select an existing instance of the deleted component. Do one of the following to restore the component: If you are in the library file that contained the main component, click the Restore Component button from the properties panel in the right sidebar. • If you are in a file that did not contain the main component, click the Go to main component in library icon. Then click the Restore button in the dialog window. ### From the right-click menu • Right-click on the instance in the canvas. Do one of the following to restore the component: If you are in the library file that contained the main component, hover over the Main component option and click Restore main component. • If you are in a file that did not contain the main component, click Go to main component. Then click the Restore button in the dialog window. Was this article helpful? Yes No Help Center feedback Got a second? Tell us what we’re doing well.
