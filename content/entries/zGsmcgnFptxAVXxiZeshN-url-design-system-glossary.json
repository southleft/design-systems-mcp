Like a light switch in your house. Design Token - Nicknames for your design decisions. Component Library - A box full of your favorite pieces. When you need something, just reach in and grab it. UI (User Interface) - The things people click, tap, and type into. Like the dashboard of a car. UX (User Experience) - How it feels to use your thing. Like a door that opens the way you expect. Atomic Design - Start with tiny bits, then merge. Figma - A digital whiteboard where everyone can draw together. Handoff - When designers give their work to developers, with clear instructions. Documentation - A cookbook that explains how everything works. Accessibility - Making sure everyone can use it, no matter their situation. Version Control - Like saving different drafts of your work, so you can go back if needed. Prototyping - Building a rough version to test your ideas. Like sketching before painting. Responsive Design - Your design adjusts to fit any screen. Grid System - Invisible lines that help keep everything tidy. Branding - The personality of your product. What makes people recognize it's yours. Technical Debt - The price you pay later for taking shortcuts now. Scalability - Building something that can grow without breaking. Consistency - When everything works the same way everywhere. Modularity - Building with pieces that snap together like Lego. Style Dictionary - Turns your design choices into code that developers can use. Usability Testing - Watching real people use your thing to see where they get stuck. Governance - Rules to keep everything running smoothly. Onboarding - Teaching new people how to use your system quickly. Framework - Pre-built pieces that give you a head start. Adaptability - How well your system handles change. Cross-Platform - Works everywhere: phones, computers, tablets. Visual Hierarchy - Arranging things so the important stuff catches your eye first.
