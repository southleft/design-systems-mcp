Romina Kavcic This article covers how you can structure Figma Variables for single or multi-brand theme. How do you organize Figma Variables? Do you make a separate file for design tokens, or do you add them in your component library file? My preferred way to handle Figma variables is to create: ↪️ Create a Figma file called Foundations (or primitives, or core) Add all the colors Add all the numbers (spacings, paddings, border radius, etc) Publish the library. ↪️ Open a new Figma file, called Semantic design tokens Here you can \"call\" the values from your foundations and define all the reusable design tokens Publish the library and make it available for your team. ↪️ Create a new Figma file for your component (for example \"Accordian\") Add your Semantic Figma library Add your Foundations Figma library Connect layers with Figma variables This structure lets you hide Foundations from your design system's users.
