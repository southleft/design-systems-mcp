Adoption Oct 18, 2024 by Nezar Mansour Design systems have become the backbone for maintaining consistency and efficiency across products, but building a design system is only half the battle; the real challenge lies in driving its adoption through hands-on collaboration. When creators and users actively collaborate, the design system not only gains more relevance but also sees quicker and more effective integration into daily workflows. Here, we dive into nine proven practices for promoting collaborative adoption in design systems, complete with real-world examples and insights from industry leaders. ### Interactive workshops and training sessions Interactive workshops are more than just learning opportunities; they create a space where design system creators and users can build relationships and align on goals. By addressing actual challenges in real-time, workshops foster a shared understanding of the design system&#x27;s components and guidelines. This hands-on, collaborative approach helps demystify the design system for users, giving them the confidence to integrate it into their work and providing creators with valuable feedback. When users leave these sessions feeling empowered and heard, adoption becomes a natural, ongoing process. How to run effective workshops: • Tailor sessions: Adapt workshops to the specific needs of different teams. • Engage in collaborative exercises: Build components or solve design challenges using the system. • Solve real problems: Address current issues participants are facing, making each session valuable and practical. Cintia Romero, Design Systems Lead at Pinterest, along with other panelists, highlighted during a webinar that interactive workshops and training sessions are key for fostering alignment and system adoption. “We say that education and adoption is a chain of events, but everything starts with education.” Watch the webinar [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJp-PFmnuwo] to learn more about how workshops and training sessions foster alignment and adoption. Also check out Minnie Huang&#x27;s guide of how to conduct a workshop for your design system [https://minniessuyuhuang.com/project/design-system-content-workshop]. ### Establish design system office hours Office hours offer a dedicated and accessible time for team members to discuss their design system challenges directly with its creators. This approach promotes a culture of open communication and support. Unlike formal meetings, office hours are usually more relaxed, allowing for spontaneous problem-solving and knowledge sharing. They help bridge gaps between teams and ensure that issues are resolved quickly, which boosts confidence in using the design system. Additionally, the creators gain insights into the everyday hurdles users face, leading to better system improvements over time. How to set up office hours: • Schedule regular sessions (weekly or bi-weekly). • Promote attendance through internal channels. • Keep the environment informal to encourage questions and discussion. Lauren Beatty, Staff Engineer at Zapier, emphasizes that holding regular office hours is crucial for building trust and knowledge within teams: “It creates a tight feedback loop with your consumers... Trust is so important for a design system. If folks don’t trust the system, they’ll seek solutions elsewhere.” Learn more about the importance of office hours from Lauren Beatty&#x27;s article [https://www.supernova.io/blog/building-effective-communication-and-collaboration-for-design-systems-teams]. ### Integrate feedback loops Feedback loops are critical in making users feel heard and valued. When users know that their input directly influences the design system&#x27;s evolution, they are more likely to engage with and adopt it. This two-way dialogue not only helps refine the design system but also builds trust between creators and users. Moreover, feedback loops help identify pain points early, allowing for more targeted improvements. By actively seeking and acting on feedback, you demonstrate that the design system is a living, responsive framework that evolves to meet the team&#x27;s needs. How to integrate feedback: • Set up multiple channels: Use surveys, suggestion boxes, and direct communication. • Act on feedback: Prioritize changes and communicate updates to show users that their input makes a difference. Alberto Calvo, previously in charge of the design system at Maze, shared the importance of integrating feedback loops: “Meeting people where they are is key. We have dedicated jam sessions and office hours weekly. We also have design systems meets every month to communicate and discuss changes with the team, gather ideas, and see what&#x27;s working and what isn&#x27;t.” Explore more about feedback loops in our webinar recap [https://www.supernova.io/blog/design-system-documentation-is-a-moving-target-panel-recap]. ### Utilize collaboration tools Collaboration tools provide a virtual workspace that brings everyone onto the same page. Real-time tools like Figma or Slack make it easier for users to see the design system in action, share feedback, and contribute to its growth. These tools break down barriers to communication, allowing for a seamless exchange of ideas. Centralized documentation plays a key part [https://medium.com/@ericascolaro/design-system-documentation-a-key-pillar-for-consistent-and-collaborative-ui-development-38013a4607a7] in helping users work with the most up-to-date components, while reducing inconsistencies and errors. When users see the design system integrated into their daily tools, it becomes part of their workflow, accelerating adoption. Tools to consider: • Design: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD for shared workspaces. • Communication: Slack, Microsoft Teams for open channels. • Documentation: Supernova, Notion, Confluence for centralized resources. OneSignal&#x27;s use of Supernova enabled them to create a single source of truth, improving collaboration and accelerating onboarding. Charles Kantz, Design System Lead at OneSignal, shared: “Documented design decisions in Supernova have provided clear answers... It&#x27;s just like a one-stop shop for all the information that you need.” Discover more about OneSignal&#x27;s journey in establishing a single source of truth with Supernova in our case study [https://www.supernova.io/blog/establishing-a-single-source-of-truth-onesignals-journey-with-supernova]. ### Implement incentive programs for cross-team adoption Incentives recognize and reward the effort that goes into adopting and contributing to the design system, transforming it from an optional tool to a valued part of the workflow. When users see their contributions acknowledged and rewarded, it reinforces the value of the design system and encourages continued involvement. How to incentivize: • Recognition: Offer titles to high contributing individuals like \"Design System Champion of the Month.\" • Rewards: Gift cards, team outings, or professional development opportunities. • Gamification: Implement points systems for contributions that lead to rewards. We have an in-depth guide on improving adoption of your design system [https://www.supernova.io/blog/navigating-adoption-overcoming-design-system-challenges], covering practical strategies to overcome challenges and foster collaboration. ### Send regular newsletters and updates Regular updates keep the design system at the forefront of users&#x27; minds, providing them with timely information, inspiration, and reminders of its value. When users see their work or input featured in newsletters, it reinforces their connection to the design system and motivates further engagement. What to include in newsletters: • Recent updates: Highlight new components or changes. • Team spotlights: Recognize contributions from different team members. • Upcoming events: Promote workshops, office hours, and community events. Lauren Beatty, Staff Engineer at Zapier, suggests [https://www.supernova.io/blog/building-effective-communication-and-collaboration-for-design-systems-teams] using bite-sized communications, such as “video demos or a feed channel celebrating outside contributions to the system,” to make updates easy to consume and engaging for users. ### Create comprehensive guides and documentation Comprehensive documentation is the backbone of a successful design system. It serves as the go-to resource for users, providing clarity on how to implement the system effectively. Well-crafted documentation reduces the learning curve, making it easier for teams to understand and adopt the design system. By including detailed guidelines, visuals, and examples, documentation becomes a tool that empowers users to solve problems independently, reducing reliance on the creators and promoting more widespread use. Key documentation: • Getting started manuals: For onboarding new users. • Component libraries: Detailed information on components and usage. • Contribution guides: Instructions for how users can add to the system. Industry experts from Maze and NewsKit have previously shared how their teams focus on comprehensive documentation to improve adoption. Learn more about improving design system documentation in our webinar recap [https://www.supernova.io/blog/design-system-documentation-is-a-moving-target-panel-recap]. ### Measure adoption and success Measuring adoption provides concrete data to guide future improvements and validate the design system&#x27;s impact [https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/adopting-design-systems-71e599ff660a]. Sharing these insights with the team fosters transparency and can serve as a source of motivation. When users see tangible progress and the impact of their involvement, it reinforces the value of adopting and contributing to the design system. Metrics to track: • Participation rates: Attendance at workshops and office hours. • Contribution counts: Number of user contributions. • Component usage: Frequency of design system components in projects. Our recent panel discussion featured experts Andrew Clark (H&R Block), Cintia Romero (Pinterest), and Maya Hampton (REI), who highlighted the importance of using analytics to drive adoption. They discussed metrics such as participation rates, component usage, and tools like Figma Analytics and Google Analytics for effective adoption tracking. Find out more about using analytics to drive adoption in our panel recap [https://www.supernova.io/blog/increasing-and-measuring-usage-adoption-of-design-systems-panel-recap]. ### Secure leadership support and advocacy Leadership support sets the tone for adoption across the organization [https://medium.com/john-lewis-design/design-system-adoption-the-importance-of-stakeholder-buy-in-6a0d6ea7880e]. Effective leadership actions include public endorsements of the design system, allocating resources for its development, and actively participating in community events, which demonstrate commitment and prioritize its use. This top-down support gives the design system the legitimacy it needs to thrive. How to gain support: • Demonstrate value: Present data on how collaboration enhances the design system&#x27;s success. • Involve leadership: Encourage leaders to participate in events and recognize efforts. Learn how to executive buy-in for your design system from our in-depth guide [https://www.supernova.io/blog/securing-buy-in-for-your-design-system-a-lifecycle-approach]. Collaborative adoption in design systems doesn&#x27;t happen by accident; it requires intention, effort, and the right strategies. One of the most impactful strategies is building a strong community, as it fosters a sense of ownership and collaboration that drives meaningful and sustained adoption. From facilitating interactive workshops to securing leadership support, each practice contributes to a design system that is dynamic, user-driven, and effective.
